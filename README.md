# movie_data
Built a Power BI dashboard using real Bollywood data of 1800+ movies to analyze collections, genres, actors, and yearly trends. Created 3 interactive dashboards (Genre, Box Office, Year-wise) with buttons & bookmarks. Used DAX to find Top 10 movies, yearly counts, avg. collections & flops. Cleaned data, extracted year from release date, and added filters, slicers, charts for insights. Strong focus on interactivity and real-time decision-making.
